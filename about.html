      <h1>Frid0l1n</h1>
      <p>
        Meet Frid0l1n, a Swiss guy üá®üá≠ and sports enthusiast üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. While serving in
        the military as a Strategic Radio Explorer, my heart beats for computers
        üíª. I dream of diving into computer science, coding, and digital tech
        once my service is over. Imagine blending my love for sports and tech to
        revolutionize the game! Watch out for this future tech guru! üöÄ

      <h4>Education</h4>
      <p>
        I spent nine years in mandatory school and completed four years of high
        school, with a focus on biology and some chemistry. However, what I
        really wanted to delve into was informatics or computer science. Biology
        wasn't my true passion; it was more of a choice I made at the time.
        During college, I participated in experiments and academic activities
        related to biology and chemistry, but my heart was leaning towards
        informatics. Now, I'm eager to pursue my true interest in informatics
        and see where this journey takes me.

      <h4>Projects</h4>
      <h5>Financial Machine Learning using Random Forest Classifier</h5>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://github.com/Frid0l1n/Random-Forest"
          >Random Forest Classifier</a
        >
        is an attempt to dive into the field of Quantitative Finance. Although I
        haven't started working on the project yet, I'm currently highly
        motivated to work on it. The program calculates different indexes, and
        based on them, it makes its decision on whether the stock price is
        rising or falling.

      <h5>Sport Tracker App:</h5>
      <p>
        Due to my interest in sports and coding, I'm looking forward to coding a
        simple sports tracker. I don't have any experience in coding a mobile
        app, but I'm highly motivated to create an open-source and data-friendly
        mobile app. Below is a list of tools that could be used for this
        project.

      <h5>Passions</h5>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about everything related to tech and software
        development. Another passion of mine is cycling. Cycling is a nice
        escape from the literally fast-paced society, so it's really calming.
