<p>Hey there i’m Frid0l1n a Swiss guy and sports enthusiast. While
studying at ETH Zurich for my CS degree, my heart beats for computers.
I’m realy passionate about coding trying to learn some new languages and
frameworks.</p>
<p>I spent nine years in mandatory school and completed four years of
high school, with a focus on biology and chemistry (wasn’t so passionate
about it as i thought tough!). After school i served 300 days as a
strategic radio explorer in the cyber batallion 42. Now i’m studying CS
at ETH it’s hard but makes fun.</p>

Machine Learning using Random Forest Classifier</h4>
<p>The <a href="/home/nicolas/Documents/dev/frid0l1n.github.io">Random
Forest Classifier</a> is an attempt to dive into the field of
Quantitative Finance. My goal is to improve it over time since in my
opinion it’s not neat enough. The main goal was to classify stocks using
various data. It should make a decision if the stock price is going to
rise or fall.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stock price prediction using a Random Forest Classifier</li>
<li>Calculate various technical analysis indices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Python for implementing the Prediciton Model</li>
<li>Yfinance and other libraries for simplicity</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="passions">Passions</h3>
<p>I’m passionate about everything related to tech and software
development. Another passion of mine is cycling and hiking. In my
opinion cycling and hiking is a nice escape from the fast-paced society
it could be really calming and relaxing.</p>
