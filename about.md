Hey there i'm Frid0l1n a Swiss guy and sports enthusiast. While studying at ETH Zurich for my CS degree, my heart beats for computers. I'm realy passionate about coding trying to learn some new languages and frameworks.

I spent nine years in mandatory school and completed four years of high school, with a focus on biology and chemistry (wasn't so passionate about it as i thought tough!). After school i served 300 days as a strategic radio explorer in the cyber batallion 42. Now i'm studying CS at ETH it's hard but makes fun.

### Projects

#### Financial Machine Learning using Random Forest Classifier

The [Random Forest Classifier](/home/nicolas/Documents/dev/frid0l1n.github.io) is an attempt to dive into the field of Quantitative Finance. My goal is to improve it over time since in my opinion it's not neat enough. The main goal was to classify stocks using various data. It should make a decision if the stock price is going to rise or fall.

**Key Features:**

- Stock price prediction using a Random Forest Classifier
- Calculate various technical analysis indices

**Tech Stack:**

- Python for implementing the Prediciton Model
- Yfinance and other libraries for simplicity

### Passions
I'm passionate about everything related to tech and software development. Another passion of mine is cycling and hiking. In my opinion cycling and hiking is a nice escape from the fast-paced society it could be really calming and relaxing.
