<h1>Frid0l1n</h1>
<p>Meet Frid0l1n, a Swiss guy 🇨🇭 and sports enthusiast 🏃‍♂️. While serving in the military as a Strategic Radio Explorer, my heart beats for computers 💻. I dream of diving into computer science, coding, and digital tech once my service is over. Imagine blending my love for sports and tech to revolutionize the game! Watch out for this future tech guru! 🚀</p>

<h4>Education</h4>
<p>I spent nine years in mandatory school and completed four years of college, with a focus on biology and some chemistry. However, what I really wanted to delve into was informatics or computer science. Biology wasn't my true passion; it was more of a choice I made at the time. During college, I participated in experiments and academic activities related to biology and chemistry, but my heart was leaning towards informatics. Now, I'm eager to pursue my true interest in informatics and see where this journey takes me.</p>

<h4>Projects</h4>
<h5>Financial Machine Learning using Random Forest Classifier</h5>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Frid0l1n/Random-Forest">Random Forest Classifier</a> is an attempt to dive into the field of Quantitative Finance. Although I haven't started working on the project yet, I'm currently highly motivated to work on it. The program calculates different indexes, and based on them, it makes its decision on whether the stock price is rising or falling.</p>
<h6>Key Features:</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Stock price prediction using a Random Forest Classifier</li>
</ul>
<h6>Tech Stack:</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Python for implementing the Prediction Model</li>
  <li>Terminal for user input</li>
</ul>
<h5>Sport Tracker App:</h5>
<p>Due to my interest in sports and coding, I'm looking forward to coding a simple sports tracker. I don't have any experience in coding a mobile app, but I'm highly motivated to create an open-source and data-friendly mobile app. Below is a list of tools that could be used for this project.</p>
<h6>Minimum Viable Product:</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Calculate Calories</li>
  <li>Create different training routines and log the sets</li>
  <li>Open-source</li>
</ul>
<h6>Tech Stack</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Flutter for basic development</li>
  <li>Way to save the sets locally and export them to another device</li>
</ul>

<h5>Passions</h5>
<p>I'm passionate about everything related to tech and software development. Another passion of mine is cycling. Cycling is a nice escape from the literally fast-paced society, so it's really calming.</p>
